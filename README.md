## Example Playbook

Just include this role in your list.
For example

```
- host: all
  roles:
    - juju4.harden-windows
```

Run
```
$ ansible -i inventory -m win_ping win --ask-pass
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory --limit win site.yml
```

## Variables

Sample. See defaults/main.yml for full scope

```
harden_eventlogs_maxsize: 314572
```

## Continuous integration

This role has a travis basic test (for github, syntax check only) and a Vagrantfile (test/vagrant).

```
$ cd /path/to/roles/juju4.harden-windows/test/vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant provision
$ vagrant destroy
$ ansible -i .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory -m win_ping -e ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore -e ansible_ssh_port=55986 all
```

Role has also a packer config which allows to create image for virtualbox and vmware based on https://github.com/jonashackt/ansible-windows-docker-springboot/ and https://github.com/boxcutter/windows.
Plan for about 50GB of free disk space and 1h to build one image.
```
$ cd /path/to/packer-build
$ cp -Rd /path/to/juju4.harden-windows/packer .
## update packer-*.json with your current absolute ansible role path for the main role
$ cd packer
$ packer build *.json
$ packer build -only=virtualbox-iso *.json
## if you want to enable extra log
$ PACKER_LOG_PATH="packerlog.txt" PACKER_LOG=1 packer build *.json
```

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* Ensure you follow ansible guide to be able to connect
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_windows.html

* 'The property 'changed' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists and can be set.'
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17139
Ansible bug in 2.1.1, ok in 2.0.1 and 2.1.2

* AdobeReader chocolatey install issue

* most windows module in ansible are not idempotent

* Ansible win_firewall_rule module does not seem mature enough currently, especially if using non-english windows.
Consider it experimental

* ```ConnectTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='192.168.1.1', port=5986): Max retries exceeded with url: /wsman (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<requests.packages.urllib3.con)```
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16460

* packer build sometimes fails
```
==> virtualbox-iso: Deleting output directory...
Build 'virtualbox-iso' errored: Error uploading VirtualBox version: Error restoring file from $env:TEMP\winrmcp-affcbaf4-440e-481f-7ea4-16ae1b0b7121.tmp to .vbox_version: restore operation returned code=16001
```
Restarting is usually enough.
Normally addressed per https://github.com/jonashackt/ansible-windows-docker-springboot/commit/89ad651fb7a79ee98b12ea0d5718727a5926ef9e
```
==> virtualbox-iso: Deleting output directory...

```
Same, restarting is usually enough.
https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/issues/21
It also sometimes stall on ` Waiting for WinRM to become available...`
==> just stop it and restart

* ```Cannot dot-source this command because it was defined in a different language mode. To invoke this command without importing its contents, omit the '.' operator.```
It happens with Applocker enabled and non-administrator user because of Constrained Powershell. See https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/powershell-50-and-applocker-when-security-doesnt-mean-security.aspx
